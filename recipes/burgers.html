    <h1>Vegan Black Bean Burgers</h1>
<img src="img/burger.jpeg" alt="black bean burger">
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Between homemade, restaurant, and store-bought, these are the best black bean burgers I've ever tried. I'm confident you'll be satisfied with this bean burger recipe. They're big, thick, hearty, and flavorful.</p> 
<p>The trick is to partially dry out the black beans so the burgers do not taste mushy. Grill or bake the black bean burgers and enjoy on a bun, plain, or on a salad.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 <em>(14 ounce)</em> cans of <strong>Black Beans</strong>, <em>drained</em>, <em>rinsed</em>, and <em>patted dry</em></li>
    <li>1 tablespoon of extra virgin <strong>Olive Oil</strong></li>
    <li>3/4 cup of finely chopped <strong>Bell Pepper</strong> <em>(1/2 of a pepper)</em></li>
    <li>1 cup of finely chopped <strong>Yellow Onion</strong> <em>(1/2 of a large onion)</em></li>
    <li>3 <strong>Garlic Cloves</strong>, <em>minced (about 1 Tablespoon)</em></li>
    <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons of <strong>Ground Cumin</strong></li>
    <li>1 teaspoon of <strong>Chili Powder</strong></li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon of <strong>Garlic Powder</strong></li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon of <strong>Smoked Paprika</strong></li>
    <li>1/2 cup of <strong>Bread Crumbs</strong> or <strong>Oat Flour</strong></li>
    <li>1/3 cup of <strong>Mashed Sweet Potato</strong></li>
    <li>2 tablespoons of <strong>Ketchup</strong>, <strong>Mayo</strong>, or <strong>BBQ Sauce</strong></li>
    <li>A pinch of <strong>Salt and Pepper</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 325F. Spread beans evenly onto a lined baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes until slightly dried out.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, sauté olive oil, chopped pepper, onion, and garlic over medium heat until peppers and onions are soft, about 5-6 minutes. Gently blot some of the moisture out. Then, place in a large bowl or in a food processor with the remaining ingredients (Listed above). Stir or pulse everything together.</li>
    <li>Then add the black beans in. Mash with a fork or pulse the mixture, leaving some larger chunks of beans.</li>
    <li>Form into patties- about 1/3 cup of mixture in each.</li>
    <li><strong>To bake:</strong> Place patties on a parchment paper lined baking sheet and bake at 375F for 10 minutes on each side, 20 minutes total. <strong>To grill:</strong> Place patties on greased aluminum foil and grill 8 minutes on each side. Grill on medium-high heat on about 350°F. </li>
    <li>Serve with your favorite toppings and enjoy!</li>
